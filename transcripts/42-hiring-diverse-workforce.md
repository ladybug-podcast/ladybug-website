We've talked a lot about interviewing and getting hired in tech from the engineering perspective. But today we're going to build on that. We have a special guest, Hilary turnipseed, the founder of hell street strategies, and we're going to talk about hiring from the recruiting perspective.

**Kelly**  0:15  
Let's get started. Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly. I'm Allie. And I'm Emma. And we're debugging the tech industry. Are you a developer looking for your next challenge meet Shopify. They're on a mission to make commerce better for everyone. And they do things a bit differently. They don't tell you how to solve problems. They give you the tools, trust and autonomy to build new solutions. They don't want you to work alone. They're structures so you can leverage the diverse perspectives across teams and everything you do, and they don't pretend to have all the answers. They're big enough for you to tackle problems at scale, but small enough for you to discover and solve new problems. If you're a builder at heart who wants to highly technical problems, if you want to take all of your life experiences and apply them to a blank canvas, or if you want to access really powerful tools Shopify is the place for you.

**Ali**  1:13  
Awesome. Well welcome Hillary. We're so excited to have you on the show. Thank you for having me. Yeah. So excited. First off, you want to tell us about yourself and what you're involved in and what you do for work all that I've been in

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  1:29  
the DC area in DC for about 15 years. And my first job out of school was in recruitment. So what I do professionally has always been in and out of the talent acquisition, talent management space, which is just a fancy way of saying I hire people. Yeah, so it's my first job out of school, I realized pretty quickly that this was something that was naturally really exciting for me to do. I think I'm in between Pathetic person I'd like to help but this was a way to do it, but also be compensated for it and pay off student loans. And so I started off in the sort of staffing agency world, which is really just numbers driven sales really transactional. And that's just not why I do what I do. I do it for people, I'm people motivated, not necessarily money motivated. And so I quickly realized I wanted to support one brand in house and really be a strategic business partner and help a company be successful because people are your most valuable asset. And so, throughout the course of my career, I have supported hiring efforts for tech companies. And so sort of sitting at the intersection of tech, media and education so working for brands like discovery, communications or political But most recently getting a taste for the startup life, which was really interesting going from larger brands to something totally different and being more of a team of mine. Um, but it was in that time, I really got really hooked into really understanding more of what went into building products, and the engineering around it. And I also really wanted to understand why people were having an issue, finding women or people of color in their engineering teams. And so even though I've been in DC for a long time, my family actually lives in the Bay Area. And so I would often go home and you know, talk to my network out there and just see what Silicon Valley was doing and how they were doing it wrong. And I was on just sort of a mission to bring all the cool stuff to DC and to sort of get it right or at least sort of figure it out and Ollie that tell you and I met part of that was me really building more of a connection with the DC tech community. Because I really just wanted to connect the dots and understand why there was this notion of it being a pipeline problem. And then as I was interviewing, and as I was proactively reaching out to women and people of color and just saying, Hey, I have this role, I'd love to talk. I realized it was a combination of things. Women, especially women of color, we do a really good job at we do a really good job of getting in our own way. And often kind of talking ourselves out of things and the imposter syndrome is real. And then on the flip side, um, you know, being a team No one really and reporting directly to the C level leadership of this organization and really understanding from a business perspective what needed to happen. Um, I realized it was a combination of us and I say, women, people of color. That's how I identify. I'm really not even giving ourselves the opportunity to even be considered, but also, the recruiting process and the interview process interviewing process in tech is broken. Most companies, most businesses, most managers have no idea what they're looking for. And no one at least in my opinion, is ever really fully trained on how to interview.

We really just mimic what we've experienced in the past. And so that's where phrases like unconscious bias and maybe if we do blind resumes, and all of these experiments to try to Really get women to be recognized for their capabilities and not have this narrative be created about our capabilities and our ability to thrive in a startup environment where the hours might be crazy. And so it's not a pipeline problem. It is a people problem. And so I'm to go back to what I do now. And in my time at that startup, I was able to build in my opinion, one of the most diverse engineering teams in the DC area, or at least in you know, that particular industry and decided that if I was able to do this for this business, I wonder what impact I could make in a bigger way. And so 2019 I don't know how it was for you guys, but it was not the best year. I'm in jail. And so I sort of took it upon myself to just sort of take a risk, have that sort of YOLO moment and decide to create sort of an advisory consultancy, all around hiring and retaining the best talent but with an element of diversity and inclusion built into it, but not as this sort of token effort. So I go in and I advise on how to figure out what it is you really want, but also help you define what diversity means for your company. Because it is not a one size fits all and I view it pretty simply, um, think about the problem you're solving. Think about the community that your product or service is serving. And then your workforce should mirror that.

**Kelly**  7:51  
I love that. Like I lesson from you on how to tell my life story because that was amazing.

**Ali**  8:00  
Thank you for being so inspired right now. And you've hit on so many things that I think are such big pain points for so many people in this industry on so many different sides of it too for women, women of color in tech, how difficult it is to get started and feel like you belong in the industry, but then on the other side of it of like hiring and all the difficulties that come with that as well. So that was a really great introduction. Thank you entered like all of our questions for you and one also do you have

**Kelly**  8:37  
to love it? Yes. So So tell us about your company like I love a good founder story naturally. So what did you know what is your current day to day like what Who do you do you work with certain certain industries, certain size companies, like Tell me everything?

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  8:53  
Yeah. So I made this decision. This leap, I would say was round. Beginning of May of last year to decide, you know what, I'm going to do this. But I also realized I had no idea what I was doing. And over the course of my time working with founders and different leaders in a variety of different organizations, I was always taught that it's lonely at the top. And so I realized if I was going to do this, I had to do it right. And so I gave myself a good six months, you know, July, well, kind of mid July through before the holidays, really, um, to just try a whole bunch of things to see what it is that I did really spoke to the market. It was the first time that I was the product. So I had no idea what I was really serving, but I knew that I had a bigger purpose and that was to help women and people have colored it out their own way, but also be able to implement that change where It needs to happen. And that's at the top with key decision makers. And so I decided pretty early on, I was not going to be viewed as a staffing agency, I am not transactional, go call a Robert Half. That is not me. But if you are having trouble finding an engineer or a product manager or salesperson, and you really want to be intentional about making sure that that person is going to add some diversity, however we define it. Um, of course, I can absolutely help you strategically place them but what I'm not going to do is place them in an environment if I don't know if they're going to be set up for success. And so I realized very quickly, I needed to have a seat at that table. And that if we were if I was really going to make a change in this space, and really move that needle. I needed buy in from the top. And so whoever was going to list if you really cared about diversity and inclusion, but really at the end of the day, people just want to hire people and know how to keep them. And so I decided I was not an agency, I was not going to be a diversity and inclusion consultant doing a full day of unconscious bias training. No. So I decided that I didn't have to pick just one thing or two things. I wanted to pick things that I just knew in and out. That made sense in terms of supporting a company holistically. And so I support efforts on helping you identify what type of talent really works for your culture, the type of culture you really want to have, and how you want to do find that. What questions are most important when interviewing so you can probe on those areas who should be included. So I really provide frameworks for interviewing processes. And then from there, you can hire the best person, but it's not worth it if you don't have an onboarding process that makes sense. And that is conducive for the individual. And so I help you onboard and provide frameworks around that. And then from there, I want to make sure you can keep up. So sometimes, if you have a retention problem, or you know, we're really starting soup to nuts, I want to really make sure that there is enough there to really set anyone up for success regardless of how they choose to learn. And so I do a ton of training, trainings and workshops on things like inclusive interviewing best practices, how to give feedback, just little things like that. I'm really focusing on the candidate experience too, because It is an incredibly competitive market. And so as an employer, you need to recognize that candidates are interviewing you just as much as you're interviewing them. And so I felt that my unique value proposition was my connections with the DC tech community. My work with Women Who Code as a director, Black Code, collective tech, rebalance all these incredible organizations and or groups, I should say community groups that even though I wasn't in wasn't an engineer, I like to save and play one on TV. I realized that I could at least provide some value from

a hiring perspective and HR perspective and be because, um, it's not easy looking for a new job is a full time job. In and of itself, and frankly, my industry, the recruiting industry, we get a really bad rap and a really bad reputation. Um, because no one really takes the time to really understand both sides of the fence. And so, you know, you have HR, their allegiance will always be with the company, the founders, their allegiance will always be with the company. But I got in this business to help people

and uplift voices and give voices to

those who have maybe experienced things in the past that they're bringing with them. We bring so much baggage with us with every experience that we don't realize it and so, in interviewing and really having, you know, career coaching calls and realizing how many times women argued with me about being qualified for a role

and I had to remind them that I reached out to them and I will wouldn't waste my time.

And so that was where I wanted to at least use my powers for good in that sense because I'm a people person, my allegiances with humanity really and so I always just try to find ways to understand human behavior, different types of people, I kind of have to be a chameleon in a lot of ways. Because in my business, I work with so many different types of people. And then, you know, people are using personality assessments these days to understand human behavior. Um, strengths finders is one of my favorites, but I gotta say most people don't realize is that those answers can actually differ based on your state of mind.

And

**Kelly**  15:52  
we're going to pick out a good time if you take any kind of

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  15:55  
know where you're not working remotely. We are working remotely In a pandemic, it is really hard. And so leading with an even greater sense of empathy is going to be really important. But um, but in my experience, the best way to really retain talent as well as to really understand what makes each person is unique. And sometimes that's through a level of self awareness. But sometimes you have to do that self work to so self work as well. So I'm actually studying now I'm Human Design charts, where it's sort of a combination of astrology, it's not super woowoo. But it's basically using your birth chart, your birth date, time and location, and wherever, you know, Google Human Design charts, but it's really interesting because it kind of breaks human or society down to kind of like four different sort of categories roughly, but it really advises the individual on how they show up, but also how they can be the best versions for themselves. So just a quick example, I'm a manifesting generator, which means it's my default to respond to fix to solve problems. And projectors, on the other hand, believe it's projectors, I'm still standing. so pleased to just Google it, I might be wrong. Full disclaimer, I'm not certified in this. But projectors, on the other hand, wait for the invitation to be invited to solve the problem. I go for it. I manifest it. I'm like this is happening because I see the problem and I'm going to fix it and why would we wait, and then I'm going to do that. Now sometimes I know that I move too fast. So I need to slow it down. And that my way of being might not work for someone who wants to take the time to really read everything, absorb it, and then come to the table with an idea.

**Kelly**  18:01  
I just decided to pull up a website that does human design chart. My type is reflector. And you are rare. You are rare.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  18:12  
Yeah, we're rare.

**Kelly**  18:14  
I apparently have no inner authority. I have no definition my not self famous disappointments. I don't know what to make.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  18:28  
That will be a separate episode. I will literally go through and I will our will be my guinea pigs. Human Design.

I promise it does. It's not as bad as the way that you just read.

No, but it's just it's a, it's a really great way to really make sure that your teams individually are working in their optimal state because it's usually miscommunication. shins or just that lack of understanding or slowing down just to understand or let people sort of catch up, especially in startups. There's that rush to solve bias, you got to move fast, fail fast, you know, and all of that crazy jabroni Enos and his family me and one of the ways that I think I was able to build such a diverse senior level team was because I actually slowed it down. And I took the time to rethink how we were doing things. And I was fortunate enough to work with a great female chief technology officer who had all the ideas and then I was able to implement it. And so it was a really good team effort. You have to have that sponsorship from the top in order to really implement change and change is not easy for everyone. So I was met with a lot of groans that So these are steps. And, um, but I always said, Listen, if I'm wrong, I'll own it and move on. You always want to own your mistakes. You know, one of the things is women we apologize way too much. Um, but also it's a sign of growth to acknowledge and apologize if you did something actually wrong. So it's that balance. Um, but yeah, I believe I can remember correctly. Numbers sometimes are not my friend, but I'm beginning January 2019, the beginning of the year from hell. Um, I was able to my first seven hires, I believe in engineering. Were all female.

**Kelly**  20:49  
Wow, that's amazing. Wow.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  20:51  
at different levels to um, and I love challenging hiring managers and founders to this De as well obviously, you know, you know, we'd love to have a diverse candidate in space, but it's just not I would say, you just don't know where you're looking but if I happen to stumble upon one would you want me to send them to you? Yeah, sure. So, I always like to prove people wrong. But one thing that I it's part of my rules of engagement and how I operate as a business owner now because integrity, and reputation is really key. This world is small. I'm all about setting realistic expectations. So you will always get the truth for me some times I've been told I'm too transparent, but I don't like surprises and I don't like to. I don't like surprises. And I don't like to sell a dream or oversell and under deliver. I'd rather scare you out of a job. Then hire you into something and then have you come at me later and be like I lied to you. That's my point. One of my worst nightmares and and if I do mess up, I'll say, Oh, I only have that information. I'm so sorry, I will fix it, I will help you I care a lot. Maybe I care too much, but I never take on anything and say yes to something that I am not proud like that I wouldn't be proud to support as a brand, but also that I wouldn't be able to deliver on. And usually if it doesn't work, it's because they don't know what they're looking for. So you know, knock on wood, I can confidently say that I've had 100% placement rate and as a non agency because I take the time to listen and understand the business. And sometimes my process and way of doing things is not for everyone, and as a female. As a woman of color. business owner. It was really Hard to learn how to say no. And also realize that rejection is just redirection. Very cool. It sounds like all of our listeners should hire you

**Ali**  23:12  
for amazing things. Awesome. So for the rest of the show, I want to break it into two parts. So the first one is going to be from the higher ed perspective, like, what can people do to set themselves apart in the interview process? And also that just search process? How do you even get to the interview in the first place? And then the second part will be from the company perspective. So what can companies do to hire a more diverse workforce? So my first question for you is what advice would you give to somebody who's looking to get their first role in tech?

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  23:50  
Great, loaded question. Yeah, that's a

**Ali**  23:53  
loaded question. Yeah.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  23:54  
I'm going to answer this from the angle of you. not graduating from a four year university and computers with a computer science degree. I'm going to answer this from the lens of you're doing a career change. But non traditional background. Awesome. So I'll start with the advice first because I feel like everyone needs to hear this from time to time. When you apply for a job when you look for a new job, I mentioned this earlier, it is like a full time job in and of itself. You're throwing resumes out there, they're going into a black hole, you don't know who's looking, there's all these weird rounds and you have to do assessments, you know, make sense and there's no communication in the process and it's just frustrating.

Unknown Speaker  24:46  
So some stats.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  24:49  
Most recruiters look at resumes for an average of five to seven seconds. The larger the brand, you have to assume that you are one of five Hundred resumes. And a recruiter is gonna either leverage their applicant tracking system and search keywords that match up to the job description. And then they'll narrow it down from there. Or they'll just look at the first maybe 10 or 20 that look good, and then just go from there. It's important for you to know that you're not alone. And that it's not personal. And you need to be forgiving yourself. Especially right now, the unemployment rate in the US is, I have no words for it. So it's too high. And so

**Kelly**  25:42  
it's also worth noting that we're recording this episode, like in May, early May, during the, you know, high peak of the pandemic. We've been having these weekly unemployment reports this episode's going to launch in in June. So give it time or giving a timeframe around that.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  26:00  
The long term impacts of COVID really are everything that you've ever learned about recruiting or cover letters and how to interview best. It's, it's sort of you got to throw it all out the window right now. Because we're all just still trying to make it day by day. And companies especially, are going to lean towards being even more conservative right now in making an investment with anyone that they hire because the cost of a bad hire could equal up to I think 80% of a first year salary. Um, and it really just, I see now more than ever, things are changing the status quo is no more people are being comfortable now interviewing and hiring people that they've never met or rethinking and remote work in general. So I think that this is going to this is a great time now for non traditional candidates to really get the upper hand. And so what I look for and I think what any sort of tech company or startup really that is, you know, that you'd want to work for a brand that's, you know, up and coming latest technologies. It's exciting, you know, a few things, and it's a big pivot. And so you have to recognize that whatever environment you were coming in before transitioning into the tech space, especially as a minority or as a woman, it is going to be incredibly different. Or maybe the same depending on where you're coming from, but it's highly competitive. Most engineering team cultures I've seen and experienced are incredibly toxic. I'm hoping that's getting better. It's incredibly male, white dominated. Um, and the way that you need to think about this is you are the person You know, essentially and so you need to have a connection with that organization that you are applying for, to leverage the transferable skills that you do have, let's say you were really mission driven and you care about cancer research, because it is really hitting home for you. And maybe you worked at a hospital for a period of time. If you have experience that directly connects to the community that that company's product deserving, that automatically makes you a stronger engineer, because you're able to view things from a customer perspective. And so being technically capable is just one piece of the interview. And frankly, I hope we eventually do away with the coding challenge. lunches or things like that or pay people for their time to do it. But really, most people just need to have a general understanding of the role. But if you have an existing team that is invested in onboarding, and giving the tools and resources to support anyone for success, it doesn't matter. If you were a four year college, graduate and you had zero work experience, versus you've been 10 years in the in the working world and you're making this pivot. That 10 year plus person is way more valuable. Because most products are solving a problem. That is a good chance to meet him dealt with and so don't focus too much on what language should I study what's most popular right now? What are people doing? Don't think about that. Think about the companies that would get you excited. Don't worry about being so flexible about salary that you just want to get a job. You're not desperate. you invested in yourself to make this move. So why should you settle?

And so it's competitive. But as I mentioned before every rejection is it will lead you to a new direction. And so

working on getting Get yourself a mentor in this space. Just slide into someone's DMS respectfully and just ask for advice, or LinkedIn or someone in that company that you really admire. You've never met, send them a note. It's all about the approach and going above and beyond because you want to stand out and people stand out especially in startups. If founders Or the team feel like they're going to be behind the mission. Because if you're just money motivated, and you want to get to the next thing, you're a flight risk. And so that can actually work against you. And so how I interview and how I hire, it's less about your experience. Cuz I'm assuming if we're talking, I think at least on paper you are worth talking to. So always make sure you have someone else. Look at your resume for you. One time I couldn't spell the word duh. And I was going crazy. So just a second set of eyes.

**Kelly**  31:36  
I'll never forget about the time that I applied for a company or for an internship when I was in college, and I didn't realize that my cover letter where I started with to whom it may concern or whatever I said, I absolutely typed Tw o

Unknown Speaker  31:52  
cos What?

**Kelly**  31:54  
Guess what? nobody's talking about anywhere.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  31:57  
Writing cover letters. I think we capable, you really want to invest in someone who's coachable, who's going to be open to feedback. I thrive on feedback. But I also work really hard on being self aware. So for me this you could have maybe one year of experience compared to five plus years. But if you did your research, if you went above and beyond showed yet you care about the mission, and and actually like did your homework because I will also respect your time too and not put you through the wringer because you also want to make sure you know if your interview process is three weeks long, tough luck. You got to move fast. But it's also about going with your gut and really figuring out you know, what they don't know it's not perfect, but it's perfect for us because at the end of the day, no one's going to come in knowing every single thing that you need. It's all about being able to thrive in ambiguity. Be flexible, and I always say Healthy People ask for what they want and what they need. And so my advice to any career seeker making this shift is to really be forgiving of yourself. Join your local Women Who Code group, you know, everyone is in the same boat together and so and share war stories. It's hard out there but you're not alone. Don't take it personally. be resilient because the interview process is akin to a startup to, you know, it's not for the faint of heart. I'd like to tell people and it's not for everyone and so be flexible, be patient, be open minded, and go with your gut. Think about it might not be your forever your perfect role, but will it get you closer to the next step in your career? Then take it and so yeah, so then fake it till you make it. Most women only apply to roles where we meet 90 to 100% of the requirements. Man, I think it's like 10 20%

**Kelly**  34:03  
I love it. That's, that's crazy.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  34:07  
So um, as I like to tell some of my clients that I coach who might be dealing with impostor syndrome, from time to time, embrace your inner mediocre white guy, and apply for that role. And from the flip side, from a company standpoint, stop coming up with a laundry list of requirements that you know, you don't really need. Focus on what you must have versus your nice to haves. And recognize that a job description is also your opportunity to tell your story of why people would even want to work for you. It goes both ways. employer branding is really key marketing and recruiting should always go hand in hand. You should be acquiring customers the same way you're requiring candidates. And so I'm hoping that you know, this sort of new normal that we're in, we're really We two companies really thinking more outside of the box because there's no blueprint from for where we are now.

**Kelly**  35:09  
I love that. Also, you may like the perfect transition from going from talking about candidates to talk to you about company. So yeah, let's let's actually talk about that. So you focus a lot on on hiring a diverse tech workforce, which is awesome. So what advice would you give to a company who's trying to diversify their diversify their hiring,

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  35:32  
before you do anything, just find what diversity means for your organization, however you decide to do it. And a lot of times, you know, if it's a larger company towards an HR department, and maybe they have an employee resource group or something, you know, you don't have to reinvent the wheel here. Just ask your team, ask your employees how they would define your company. They would define your values because they're a part of that. Honestly, you know, they're going to be a huge part of maintaining the company culture and innovating that. So don't speak for or at your employees, especially if you want to create a culture of inclusivity. So before you even think about hiring, you better make sure that you have a culture that is set up to set them up for success.

**Kelly**  36:24  
I love that I love involving the employees in the entire process, because at the end of the day, the employees are the ones who are keeping your company running. It's not you.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  36:33  
Exactly, and they're the ones who are actually going to be a part of the interview process. So if they're disengaged, if they're not a champion of your brand, you know, you have to think about them as marketing to and so and that's where it's okay to pause hiring. And make sure everyone involved in the interview process is on the same page and knows what you're looking for. And you're not asking the same questions and you're being intentional Because I noticed phrases being used a lot more now. But I mean, I'd like to think I coined it back in 2018. But it's okay.

**Kelly**  37:09  
We'll give you credit

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  37:10  
and it's on one of my LinkedIn blogs. But um, but the way that I view culture is I hate the term culture fit. You should never have to study for a culture interview, Amazon. Anyone diversity of thought, whatever it is thinking about the community that you're serving, people should add to your workforce, your culture so you can continue to innovate and grow and stay relevant for your clients. Think about how you're creating space for your employees to give you feedback, think about do you have a culture that values feedback? Because probably not a lot of folks, especially women and minorities, we're not really going to go to HR. We're worried about the repercussions What if we, what if our managers HR, who do we go to? And so building ways where your employees can also give feedback anonymously. And you can always maintain a regular pulse of your culture. Everyone should have an employee Net Promoter Score, to see how their employees feel about the product, the direction of the company, and the confidence in their leadership. I see too many times. managers or executives just make assumptions. When really all you have to do is ask

**Kelly**  38:34  
amazing what asking a question can do. It's it's so easy.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  38:38  
Yeah. And so, yeah, and so the salary question to just go back to candidates real quick. Don't ever feel pressured to tell someone what you were currently making? I agree.

**Kelly**  38:51  
I have a lot of really mixed feelings on on the whole salary topic in general.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  38:55  
Yes, this is but this is how I asked the question just so you know that you can decide If this you know if I was interviewing you how you would feel about this question, but I say especially in startups, so you know, if they're making a big pivot, you know, it's I know it's hard. You don't want someone who's just going to clock in and out and not be engaged but can be flexible. But you can work from home treat people like adults, everyone.

**Kelly**  39:19  
I ask,

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  39:21  
Where would you need to be either at a minimum or at a range? That would get you excited?

Unknown Speaker  39:29  
I like that. I really like that.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  39:32  
Yeah. And how women and I asked that to everyone. How Men respond and how women respond to that question are polar opposite. And, you know, if anyone listening to this has experienced in interview with me before, I've been known from time to time to argue with

female candidates in particular if I don't like their answer, I

**Kelly**  40:01  
think it's a tough love and we need to be like people need to be told

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  40:05  
that we have to have our own backs as women and in my opinion, we are we meaning women, we are pretty responsible for the gender pay gap. Think about it. HR is a pretty female dominated industry. Yeah, we have that power to decide compensation and worth and unconsciously, a lot of times sometimes it's consciously the microaggressions that come up between women, men, it happens. Women can be really nasty to one another, but I've just seen

hiring managers, HR managers recruiters, oh, like, assume

that a woman candidate is June

And offer less. And then when I push back and say Why, what's the justification? They have this, this, this, this, this, this this?

Unknown Speaker  41:11  
Oh really? Oh, I just assumed.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  41:14  
And so for me, I always push back. I always look at what the market rate is. I always want to know if we're competitive and if we're not, I'll tell you we're not. A lot of times I'm used to having a really tight budget, but guess what, HR? It's okay. All you have to do is just be honest and say, we know our budget is under market but to make up for it, we do have flexible working arrangements, this this and that. Because really, especially if it's a nonprofit and mission driven, one of my clients right now is Black Girls CODE. If you are money motivated a Black Girls CODE we're in we're having the wrong conversation. Um, because that is something where I think that will come back to bite you at the end. We're in a new phase in this in this society in this world where we really need to really come together and be more united. So let's help each other help ourselves and there's enough money and business. Well, maybe not right now. But there's enough opportunity out there where, you know, if we just help each other, help ourselves and provide that different perspective, without it coming from a place of really insecurity or imposter syndrome. You know, I think that as women we could really, really make a bigger difference a lot quicker to know we

**Ali**  42:42  
met because we were both co directors of Women Who Code in DC, which is an amazing organization. It is. So well attended like DC is kind of a smaller city, especially for tech, I would say but has, I think the biggest Women Who Code chapter and there are Almost every night with a huge amounts of people on them, so that's like a huge shout out for Women Who Code in DC but also elsewhere. Um, but you're also super involved with or other organizations in the DC tech community like Black Girls CODE and Black Code collective, I think right, black girls codes national,

Unknown Speaker  43:20  
okay. So, DC femmes, I would say, Dc fabtech

**Ali**  43:27  
also another amazing one based in DC. Awesome. Um, why is that involvement so important to you, especially considering your role in your company.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  43:39  
Initially, I I was tasked in my last sort of in house role that it was really important to have our engineering team in the office in DC, especially early on in the process. And And so, for me I realized I needed to really understand the DC tech community if I was going to

a recruit for a brand that no one knows about what the narrative are, because I was used to working with large brands that they know. I mean, everyone wants to work for discovery channel and Shark Week. I mean, that was easy. But this was the, you know, the first time where I really had to be creative for almost all of the roles and really focus more on, you know, the brand awareness piece, but really defining what the company culture was going to be like. And so, I invested a lot and employer branding at first, but I realized, okay, I need like, I need to see what's in my backyard. I've been in I've been a DC resident for over 15 years and let me let's, let's start sponsoring some of these meetups First, let's get them to see our office. It's cool, but it's not too cheesy because we're not here where we're just gonna bribe you with perks. So that way you Never leave like, No, we care. And I really just wanted to just have just more regular conversations that wasn't in an interview. To really understand what engineers regardless of gender we're looking for out of a new role. I really wanted to know what was important to them when assessing any new opportunity. And from there, it allowed me to speak on those things if I were in an interview, because it might be important to someone else. Um, but it also made me really aware of the blockers both in the actual just the general interviewing hiring process, but also in the candidate pool. There were a lot of assumptions being made by candidates because maybe they had one or two really are maybe five really bad experiences and maybe they just decided to Not even trying anymore because most recruiters didn't want to give feedback. And so they didn't know how to adjust and giving feedback is pretty touchy. But I always say, as long as your feedback is coming from a good place, you can control how people choose to respond. But it was really important for me to make sure and really increase, you know, the impact that that community group could really have. So that way, they could get feedback from maybe on a safer space. And I could leverage my expertise in this sort of community. And then that would help the greater tech community by increasing the pipeline again, because we're going to get out of our way. And so I really, it's really just started with me wanting to just learn the market and learn what I was up against and And really from there be very intentional with how I recruited and how I hired. And I always try to be honest in the initial conversation. And if it's not a fit, I mean, for a long time, I mean, I think naturally I'm quiet. I try to avoid conflict, and I never want to hurt anyone's feelings. But, you know, going back to if it's coming from a place of good and it will help, you know, even just closing the loop. But also I made it a point. And it was something that we really had embedded in our culture where, if you came in an interview, when you spent time, you know, out of your day to interview and we didn't move forward, I'm going to give you a call and let you know, I'm not going to send you a blanket email. And so it's really just treating people how you want to be treated, treated, but I knew that there was so much I didn't know and you don't and you don't know unless you ask. So that was I started off as sort of hosting and then quickly, the manifesto. generator in me saw a lot of opportunity to improve processes and improve impact more and, and so that was where I, you know, I think I helped a lot. It's hard for me to really say no and so over time I really just kind of got sucked in and it's just there's so many groups now but I think we're working to try to consolidate a little bit but it is just that the demand is there and the need is there and it's it's just a really exciting it's a really special community DC and yeah, I'd I don't see myself leaving anytime soon, even though I do operate in New York in the Bay Area and La as well, but DC, you know, do you see is definitely special. And Ali, I'm a little bummed that you left?

**Ali**  48:48  
No, it's amazing. It's amazing how such a small city and the city that's not stereotyped as a Tech City has so much going on. It's so impressive and Very, very cool. I definitely miss the tech community there. But also excited to spread my wings a little bit in New York City to Awesome. Well, like I said, kind of at the beginning of the episode, it would be amazing if our listeners were able to find you afterwards because you're doing some amazing things that it'd be so cool for them to both connect with you and also hire you because you have a lot of amazing services too. So where are the best places for people to find you online.

**Hilliary Turnipseed**  49:28
